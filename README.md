# CarPricePrediction
This project uses the Random Forest algorithm to analyze a dataset of car prices in order to understand which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car and how well those variables describe the price of a car. The project begins by reading in a dataset and cleaning the data.
The project then goes on to create several visualizations of the data to understand the distribution of car prices by fuel type, body type, and engine type. It then uses a linear multivariate model of price using various car features and provides a summary of the model. Finally, it uses the Random Forest algorithm to fit a model to the data and analyze the importance of each feature in predicting the price of a car.
